# Overview
This repository contains ready to print files of the [_Significant Digits_](http://www.anarchyishyperbole.com/p/significant-digits.html) fanfiction written by Alexander D. 

PDF files were generated using a script made by George Steel. The scripts can be found here [ github.com/george-steel/sigdigs-ebook ](https://github.com/george-steel/sigdigs-ebook).

Cover images were remixed from this repository [ github.com/ianstormtaylor/hpmor ](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/hpmor) to match the same style but be distinctive enough to be easily identifiable as a series of its own.

# Disclaimer
The books were not yet printed and proof read. There may be formatting mistakes.

# Contributing
If you find any formatting mistake, please contact me or open an Issue. I will try to fix the mistake as soon as possible. 

# Printing
The files supplied are ready-to-print using [Lulu.com](https://www.lulu.com/). After I receive my copies, I will add photos of the finished product here.
